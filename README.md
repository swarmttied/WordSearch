# WordSearch

This is one of those applications I moved from my other github account. I wrote it 6 years ago as a take-home interview question. 
The requirement is to create an application that solves a word puzzle. The word puzzle and the words to search come as separate text files.

## Running the app
The driver program is a console application that displays the answers as shown below.

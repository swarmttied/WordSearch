# WordSearch

I wrote this applicatoin 6 years ago as a take-home interview question. I did not get the position that time because someone beat me to the submission but I thought it's a great app for case study.
The requirement is to create an application that solves a word puzzle. The word puzzle is a text file which the application parses to determine where a particular word is.
The test cases are given on a separate text file. 

## Running the app
The driver program is a console application that displays the answers as shown below.
